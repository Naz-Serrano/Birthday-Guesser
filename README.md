# Birthday-Guesser

The Birthday Guesser is a Java program that lets the user guess a birthday. The program comes with three default people that they can guess from. The user is able to input two date formats, DD/MM/YYYY & MMM DD, YYYY. The game will then provide hints depending on the difficulty on the person.
1, only tells whether or not the year inputted is earlier than or later than the birthdate of the person
2, provides hints for month and year
3, provides hints for day, month, and year

The program utilized multiple classes, abstract classes, and various logic checks insuring the guessing game runs as intended. The user is also able to enter their own people during the program for more customization in their gameplay. I have also improved other outputs in the program ensuring for better user-friendly layout.
This program was able to display foundational knowledge of Java code using abstract classes and functions. 
This was a coursework project which was graded and received as a 95%.
